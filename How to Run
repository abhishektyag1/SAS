1 Go to the src in SAE project 
2 Right click and choose 'open in Terminal' and run the below command.
3 ./runclient "register" "username" "threshold" "metaData" "allegation" "R" 
explanation:
	The "register" keyword will allow the system to identify a registration process.
	"Username" This is the unique file name that will be saved in the src folder. This file is then used to get the data such as Mac and public keys and Uid etc.
	"R" restricts the user to file the same allegations against the same adversary. It is also used to compute Uid.
	"Allegation" is the text of the allegation without space. e.g. "My_name_is_abhishek" and not "my name is abhishek."
	"metaData" and "R" should be a number
eg. ./runclient register abhishek 3 12334 I_am_not_geting_much_work 563456354
